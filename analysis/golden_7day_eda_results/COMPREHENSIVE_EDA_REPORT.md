## Recommendations for ML/LLM Development

### For Deep Neural Networks:
1. Use engineered physics-based features (distance, signal deviation)
2. Apply temporal encodings (sine/cosine transformations)
3. Consider sequence models (LSTM, Transformers) for trajectory prediction
4. Implement attention mechanisms for multi-sensor fusion

### For LLM Training:
1. Rich contextual data available (callsigns, squawk codes, positions)
2. Temporal narratives can be constructed from flight paths
3. Multi-sensor perspectives provide diverse viewpoints
4. Anomaly detection can be framed as text classification

### For Research:
1. Statistically significant sample size (600K+ records)
2. Multi-day coverage captures daily and weekly patterns
3. Cross-sensor validation enables robust analysis
4. Physics-based validation possible with derived features

## Next Steps

1. **Model Development**: Train baseline models using ML-ready dataset
2. **Feature Selection**: Conduct recursive feature elimination
3. **Anomaly Detection**: Implement unsupervised learning algorithms
4. **Trajectory Prediction**: Build sequence-to-sequence models
5. **Real-time Pipeline**: Deploy models for live data streams
