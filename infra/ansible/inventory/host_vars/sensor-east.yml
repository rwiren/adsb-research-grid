# DESCRIPTION:
# Host-specific configuration for "Sensor-East", the remote field node
# deployed to the Sibbo municipality for triangulation.
#
# ARCHITECTURAL CONTEXT:
# This node utilizes recycled hardware (formerly 'sensor-test') re-imaged
# for production. It connects via ZeroTier SD-WAN and provides a third
# TDOA (Time Difference of Arrival) anchor point.
