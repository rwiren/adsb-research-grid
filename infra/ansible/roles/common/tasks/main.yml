# Role: common
# Description: Base system configuration, Firewall, and Hardware Stability fixes.
#              Applied to ALL nodes in the grid.
#
# Version: 0.5.7 (Firewall Safety Fix)
# Last Updated: 2026-01-12
#
# REVISION HISTORY:
# - v0.5.7: Reordered UFW rules to allow SSH *before* defaulting to deny (prevents lockout).
# - v0.5.6: Replaced legacy rc.local WiFi fix with NetworkManager config.
